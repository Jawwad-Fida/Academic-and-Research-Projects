### [Predicting Irregular Sleeping Patterns from Social Media: A Psycholinguistic Analysis From Tweets](https://github.com/Jawwad-Fida/Predicting-Irregular-Sleeping-Patterns-From-Tweets "GitHub Repository") - ðŸ“˜ Undergraduate Thesis
Predict whether a user is suffering from Irregular Sleeping Patterns (ISP) based on their social media interactions on Twitter. We identify users' ISP by using psycholinguistic (i.e., LIWC) and contextual (i.e., BERT) features from tweets. We then built a hybrid classification prediction model to predict usersâ€™ Irregular Sleeping Patterns from psycholinguistic traits derived from user tweets.

 - **Tools used**: Twitter API - Tweepy, LIWC2015, IBM SPSS Statistical Software.

### [DNA sequence classification by Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/Jawwad-Fida/DNA-sequence-classification-by-Deep-Neural-Network "GitHub Repository") - ðŸ“˜ Bioinformatics Project
We have worked on the DNA sequence classification problem where the input is the DNA sequence and the output class states whether a certain histone protein is present on the sequence or not. For this purpose, we have used one of the datasets from 12 different datasets that we have collected. The name of the dataset is H3K4me2. 

**Tech Stack** :  Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Keras, Tensorflow.\
