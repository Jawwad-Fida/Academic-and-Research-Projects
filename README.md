## Research Projects

### [Predicting Irregular Sleeping Patterns from Social Media: A Psycholinguistic Analysis From Tweets](https://github.com/Jawwad-Fida/Predicting-Irregular-Sleeping-Patterns-From-Tweets) (Undergraduate Thesis)
Predict whether a user is suffering from Irregular Sleeping Patterns (ISP) based on their social media interactions on Twitter. We identify users' ISP by using psycholinguistic (i.e., LIWC) and contextual (i.e., BERT) features from tweets. We then built a hybrid classification prediction model to predict usersâ€™ Irregular Sleeping Patterns from psycholinguistic traits derived from user tweets. 

 - **Domain**:  Data Science, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Mental Health, Psycholinguistic Patterns, Social Media.
 - **Tools used**: Twitter API - Tweepy, LIWC2015, IBM SPSS Statistical Software.
